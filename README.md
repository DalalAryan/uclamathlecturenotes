UCLA Math Lecture Notes

These are a collection of lecture notes that I had taken during my time at UCLA as an undergraduate student in applied mathematics. Feel free to refer to them; however, do note that many of these notes may contain minor errors so I wouldn't solely rely on them. If you do find an error, please contact me at aryandalal@ucla.edu (aryandalal [at] ucla [dot] edu). A note of acknowledgement to Dexter Chua, Ph.D. for the LaTeX template.

UCLA Math Lecture Notes

These are a collection of lecture notes that I had taken during my time at UCLA as an undergraduate student in applied mathematics. Feel free to refer to them; however, do note that many of these notes may contain minor errors so I wouldn't solely rely on them. If you do find an error, please contact me at aryandalal@ucla.edu (aryandalal [at] ucla [dot] edu). A note of acknowledgement to Dexter Chua, Ph.D. for the LaTeX template. 

NOTE: Some documents may be incomplete as I am still in the process of compiling lecture notes. As of now, MATH 135: Ordinary Differential Equations and MATH 136: Partial Differential Equations are incomplete. I am also yet to uplaod MATH 32BH: Honors Multivariate Analysis, MATH 115AH: Honors Linear Algebra and MATH 134: Linear & Nonlinear Systems of Differential Equations.
